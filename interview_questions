what is terraform state file, how do you manage it, what are its dis advantages

terraform statefile maintains state of infra

if terraformstatefile is stored in github we face below challeneges

protecting statefile, statefile consists of secrets stored, if anyone gets hands of it security will be compromised
if you make any change to infra then you have to do terraform apply and update the statefile 
else statefile will be corrupted
filename should be backend.tf this has all the configuration where s3 .tfstate file is stored
and dynamodb lock details 

you can manage statefile using remotebackends 
s3 bucket
hashicorp cloud 
azure blob storage are some examples to manage statefiles
sample
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "shahbaz-s3-terraform1" 
    key = "terraform-practice/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"

  }
}

what is terraform provisioner?
You can use provisioners to model specific actions on the local machine or on a remote machine in order to prepare servers or other infrastructure objects for service.
provisioner types
local-exec: runs commands on local machine where you are executing terraform infra
remote-exec: runs commands on remote machine which terraform is creating, this is like bootstraping user data scripts while creating instances
while doing remote-exec you need to have connection block so that Terraform knows how to communicate with the server.
file: used to copy files and directories onto remote server
All provisioners support the when and on_failure meta-arguments, on on_failure if provisioner has to continue or stops
create time provisioner: run during create time
destroy time provisioner: runs while destroying infra

  # Module inputs
  name          = "my-vpc"
  cidr          = "10.0.0.0/16"
  azs           = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
